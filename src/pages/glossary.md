-   **Relayer**: Loopring Exchange's backend system that handles order matching and settlement, deposits, withdrawals, and Zero-Knowledge Proof generation, etc.
-   **On-chain Requests**: user requests sent to Loopring Exchange through Ethereum transactions.
-   **Off-chain Requests**: user requests sent to Loopring Exchange using Loopring's API.
-   **Base Token**: the target token to trade. For example, in the LRC-ETH trading pair, LRC is referred to as the base token.
-   **Quote Token**: the token to quote price. For example, in the LRC-ETH trading pair, ETH is referred to as the base token.
-   **Size**: the quantity of the base token in an order or a fill.
-   **Volume**: the quantity of the quote token in an order or a fill.
-   **EdDSA**: the signing algorithm used by Loopring to sign off-chain requests. EdDSA is more circuit friendly compared to Ethereum's ECDSA algorithm.
